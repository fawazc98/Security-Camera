# Security-Camera
DESCRIPTION:

This project uses Python's CV library to detect motion detetction from a still frame. Upon its detection it creates a border frame by indetifying the object. It records the time stamp from when the object enters and leaves the frame which then exports the data to a csv file. Using Python's Bokeh library (similar to matplotlib) the data in the csv file is visualized into a graph to show the increase in motion detection.
